this phone is bad. heats alot and totally lost my money /-1
Worked OK for awhile now every time I tap the back it shuts off/-1
the charger did not work. My parents started using the cable directly to the phone/-1
does not work well with T-Mobile. T-Mobile closes off some towers to non-T-Mobile phones./-1
More complicated than I expected. Terrible reception. Too hard for my mom to use. Just frustrates her./-1
No internet/-1
phone reception poor with incoming calls/-1
Sounds like you are under water. It shuts off while you are on call./-1

Ok phone I buy for someone/-1
works short battery life/-1
Good tanks/1
It is a nice phone,I buy it to used when I traveled outside the US,I loved it,good smartphone for the price./1
The touch screen is fickle and unresponsive. It has zero in phone storage, so no apps. Bottom line is that I wished I would have spent a little more money and bought a different phone./-1
At first I thought it was not charging but, there was a small plastic strip over the battery that I needed to remove. After I removed it, the phone worked great!/1
This phone is horrible./-1
Speaker doesn't work right./-1

Horrible horrible phone no reception keeps downloading programs DON'T BUY/-1
Good/1
Small phone, isn't compatible with most us services but has nice color and amazing storage./-1,,
It did not work, nevera on. Too bad./-1
SLOW, SLOW, SLOW....worst phoner ever had/-1
If I could've gave it 0 stars I would have!!!! Awful phone!!! Never by from this seller again!! Phone is not up to USA standards. Maybe good across seas. But not what we're use to./-1
It was really bad literally no memory and 2 pages to put stuff on I would not recommend it unless you just wanna call in and out and take good pics/-1
i mean it works but the screen is horrendous, the viewing angles are absolutely horrible/-1
I am disappointed with The screen I love purple flowers I don't see I want to return back this phone i don't feel like using it s not same color either n also I am having hard time opening to insert the sim/-1
Not recommended. Won't charge after just a few weeks of use./-1
No the phone done have Bluetooth on it, which is so bad for my son./-1
its a good phone but barely holds any apps.The space is limited/1
I bought this phone for a gift, and when I recieved it, the phone did not work. I had to pay again to return the cellphone from Venezuela to USA./-1
It did not work./-1
Didn't work when it arrived! So I returned it! What a waste/-1
OK so far./-1
Cheap-- I am sending it back../-1
I bought this to replace my samsung galaxy s3 and this phone has went above an beyond my expectations. It works the same if not better than my Samsung did for more than half the price. I would def purchase again./1
Battery keeps running down not charging pass 60%./-1
It was slow, but worked fine. However after only 2 weeks it wouldn't charge. After diagonosis, it was charging port that was defective and could not be repaired. May be just this one i received. I ended up returning the phone./-1
Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting./-1
